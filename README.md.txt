# 🚢 Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset  

This project was completed as part of my **CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship**.  
The main objective was to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset  
to identify trends, patterns, and key factors that influenced passenger survival.

## 🎯 Objective  
The purpose of this project is to analyze the Titanic dataset using Python  
to understand how variables such as gender, age, and class affected survival rates.

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- SciPy

## 📊 Project Steps  

1. **Data Loading & Inspection** — Imported and explored the Titanic dataset.  
2. **Data Cleaning** — Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and verified data types.  
3. **Univariate Analysis** — Studied distributions of features like Age, Fare, and Pclass.  
4. **Bivariate Analysis** — Compared Survival with features like Sex, Age, and Pclass.  
5. **Correlation & Visualization** — Created heatmaps and plots to identify relationships.  
6. **Hypothesis Testing** — Performed Chi-square and T-tests for statistical validation.

## 💡 Key Insights  

1️⃣ Female passengers had higher survival rates than males.  
2️⃣ 1st class passengers were more likely to survive compared to 2nd and 3rd class.  
3️⃣ Younger passengers (below ~30 years) had better survival chances.  
4️⃣ Families of size 2–4 had higher chances of survival.  
5️⃣ Passengers who paid higher fares had better survival rates.  
6️⃣ Statistical tests confirmed that class and age significantly influenced survival outcomes.  

##  Visualizations Included  

- Missing Values Heatmap  
- Age and Fare Distribution  
- Survival by Gender and Passenger Class  
- Age vs Survival Boxplot  
- Correlation Heatmap (Numeric Features)

##  Conclusion  
Through this EDA, I learned how to clean, analyze, and visualize real-world datasets using Python.  
The Titanic dataset helped me explore how demographic and socio-economic factors impacted survival.  
This project also improved my data interpretation and storytelling skills.
